  NNT: Assume that a coin is fair, i.e., has an equal probability of coming up heads or tails when flipped. I flip it 99 times and get heads each time. What are the odds of my getting tails on my next throw?
  Dr. John: Trivial question. 1/2, of course, since you are assuming 50% odds for each and independence between draws.
  NNT: What do you say, Tony?
  Fat Tony: I'd say no more than 1%, of course.
  NNT: Why so? I gave you the initial assumption of a fair coin, meaning that it was 50% either way.
  Fat Tony: You are either full of crap or a pure sucker to buy that "50 pehcent" business. The coin gotta be loaded. It can't be a fair game.
  (Translation: It is far more likely that your assumptions about the fairness are wrong than the coin delivering 99 heads in 99 throws.)
