<ul>
<li><strong>Seed Funding</strong> is the initial capital put together by the <strong>Promoter</strong> (entrepreneur) and the <strong>Angel Investors</strong>.</li>
<li>At this point of time, the company’s <em>valuation</em> is the Seed Fund itself.</li>
<li><strong>Angel Investors</strong> provide funding on a lower investment scale at the initial stages while taking the most risk.</li>
<li>Venture Capital investors come in next with Series A funding.</li>
<li><strong>Venture Capitalists</strong> provide funding on a medium investment scale and for further funding, the company should approach Private Equity investors.</li>
<li><strong>Private Equity investors</strong> fund on a higher investment scale and likely install members on the company’s board to navigate the company in their desired direction.</li>
<li>The valuation of the company changes after each funding round - creating <em>wealth</em> in process.</li>
<li>IPO is the next step to raise further capital.</li>
<li><strong>Pvt. Ltd</strong> companies can be treated as an independent financial entity (from the owner/promoter) with a separate bank account.</li>
