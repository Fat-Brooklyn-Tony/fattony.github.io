<hr>
<p><strong>NNT</strong>: Assume that a coin is fair, i.e., has an equal probability of coming up heads or tails when flipped. I flip it 99 times and get heads each time. What are the odds of my getting tails on my next throw?<br>
<strong>Dr. John</strong>: Trivial question. 1/2, of course, since you are assuming 50% odds for each and independence between draws.<br>
<strong>NNT</strong>: What do you say, Tony?<br>
<strong>Fat Tony</strong>: I&rsquo;d say no more than 1%, of course.<br>
<strong>NNT</strong>: Why so? I gave you the initial assumption of a fair coin, meaning that it was 50% either way.<br>
<strong>Fat Tony</strong>: You are either full of crap or a pure sucker to buy that &ldquo;50 pehcent&rdquo; business. The coin gotta be loaded. It can&rsquo;t be a fair game.<br>
(Translation: It is far more likely that your assumptions about the fairness are wrong than the coin delivering 99 heads in 99 throws.)</p>
